      <p>Spending Fall 2024 at South Dakota State University was one of the most exciting experiences of my student life. As part of an exchange program from the University of Winnipeg, I was both thrilled and nervous stepping into a new academic environment, but it turned out to be incredibly welcoming and enriching.</p>

      <img src="images/classroom.jpg" alt="Classroom project">
      <p>I dove deep into technical courses like Machine Learning and Systems Programming, gaining hands-on experience that pushed my coding and problem-solving skills to the next level. I also completed research projects, including one on secure communication using SDES and socket programming in C.</p>

      <p>Outside of class, I tutored students in math and science, participated in cultural performances, and joined volunteer efforts with the local community. One of the most memorable moments was performing an Indian classical dance during International Week—it was a great way to share my culture and connect with students from across the globe.</p>

      <p>This semester taught me not just about academics but also about adaptability, leadership, and personal growth. It gave me the confidence to take on more opportunities back home—and to support others in stepping out of their comfort zones too.</p>

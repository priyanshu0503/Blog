      <p>I joined the Hindu Student Council (HSC) at the University of Winnipeg in early 2025 as an External Affairs member—and later helped build its Creative Division. What started as a way to stay connected to my cultural roots quickly became something much more meaningful.</p>

      <p>Our team worked hard to plan inclusive, vibrant events for the student community, including cultural showcases, celebrations, and interfaith collaborations. I helped manage outreach, design recruitment messages, and even invite dancers for our new Creative Team.</p>

      <p>Through HSC, I realized how student groups can truly shape campus culture. I met so many amazing people—some who shared my background, and others who simply wanted to learn. Working with them taught me how to lead with both passion and professionalism.</p>
      <p>Being part of HSC reminded me that leadership isn’t about position—it’s about building something that others can connect to and carry forward.</p>
